# Web application for Movies and Subscription Management 

This is a **NodeJS** end-to-end app based **Rest API** that provides data about members and movies. 
I developed the front end with **React/Redux**, GUI with **Material UI**, and the backend with Node.js and **Express**. The architecture is divided into Business and Data Layers.
The database is implemented using **MongoDB**. Object modeling was performed by **Mongoose** and the routers on the servers were secured using **express-jwt**.
- **Authentication** process only for allowed users or admin.
- Connection between the two web services and the client-side and used **Axios** for fetching  data.
